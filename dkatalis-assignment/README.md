# dkatalis-assignment

**Name:** Anubhav Kumar

The assignment is build in typescript and contains the unit test using jest.
The node versions used while developing this assignment is `18.10.0`.

For installing and running the code - 
1. Extract the zip folder. 
2. In the root folder run the command `npm install`
3. To run the test suite, run the command `npx jest`
4. The input is the file `./src/input.txt`.
5. To run the code, run the command `npm run fire`

The `tests` contains the jest test cases. This is inside the `/src` folder. However while compiling, the typescript ignores the test folders. 

The javascript files emitted from the typescript are placed in `/build` folder.
